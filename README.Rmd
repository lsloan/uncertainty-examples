title: "Uncertainty Examples"
output: github_document
---

Often, when someone asks me an uncertainty visualization question I throw together an RMarkdown document to work through the problem. I have started to collect some of those examples in this repository. 

If you are looking for more examples, check out the [tidybayes](http://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/) documentation as well --- the [tidybayes+brms vignette](http://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/articles/tidy-brms.html) in particular has some things not included here.


## Index

These are typically pretty roughly thrown together, and are in a bit of a stream-of-consciousness style. You have been warned.


- [proportions](proportions.md): demo of using hypothetical outcome plots (HOPs) and quantile dotplots to display uncertainty in some proportions

- [linear-regression](linear-regression.md): a variety of approaches applied to a linear regression: HOPs, density+interval, and quantile dotplots of coefficients; multiple uncertainty bands, spaghetti plots, and HOPs for uncertainty in the fit line; and posterior predictive intervals for predictive uncertainty.

- [multivariate-regression](multivariate-regression.md): a meandering attempt to improve on correlation heatmaps, including the use of gradients within density plots and a "dithering" approach.

- [barbarella](barbarella.md): visualizations for a survey with a 10-point rating scale analyzed with an ordinal regression model. Includes some posterior predictive checks, HOPs (animated uncertainty), quantile dotplots, and density+interval ("half-eye") plots.

- [arima](arima.md): visualizations of forecasts for a simple autoregressive time series model. Includes spaghetti plots and HOPs, plus demos the use of not-explicitly-supported packages with `tidybayes` (in this case, `bsts`---Bayesian structural time series).

- [snowfall](snowfall.md): quantile dotplots and HOPs for a snowfall prediction.

- [mtcars](mtcars.md): Some spaghetti plots and HOPs with mtcars data.

- [grades](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lsloan/uncertainty-examples/blob/grades/grades.html): simulated student data (with a hard "test" in week 6) and tried to plot some sideways histograms and other variants.
